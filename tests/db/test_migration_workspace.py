"""Tests for the ``conversations.workspace`` column and its check constraint.

Per ``designs/SESSION_WORKSPACE_SELECTION.md``: column is nullable so
existing rows pre-dating the feature stay valid; CLI sessions can populate
it without setting ``host_id``; but a ``host_id`` row without a
``workspace`` is forbidden by the check constraint. Without the check,
host-launched sessions could land in a permanently-broken state where
the launch frame has no path to send.
