"""Tests for the ``omnigent_conversation_metadata.archived`` column and its migration.

Per the archive-session feature: archived sessions are hidden from the
default ``GET /v1/sessions`` listing. The column is NOT NULL with a
``server_default`` of false so existing rows backfill to not-archived
when the migration applies to a populated database.

After the schema split (aa1b2c3d4e5f), ``archived`` lives on
``omnigent_conversation_metadata`` rather than ``conversations``.
