"""
Integration tests for opt-in git worktree cleanup on session delete.

Drives ``DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}`` through the full app with a fake
host registered in ``app.state.host_registry``. Verifies the
``?delete_branch`` flag gates whether a ``host.remove_worktree`` frame
is sent, and that the stored worktree path + branch (not request input)
are used. See designs/SESSION_GIT_WORKTREE.md.
